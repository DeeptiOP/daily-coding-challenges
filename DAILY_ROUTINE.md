# 📅 Daily Coding Contribution Routine

## 🌅 Morning Routine (10-15 minutes)

### Step 1: Pick Today's Problem
- Visit [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/) or [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
- Choose a problem slightly harder than yesterday's
- Problem difficulty progression: Easy → Easy → Medium → Easy → Medium → Hard

### Step 2: Create Day Folder
```bash
cd "C:\Users\deept\Desktop\daily-coding-challenges"
mkdir "2025\january\day-XX-problem-name"
cd "2025\january\day-XX-problem-name"
```

### Step 3: Solve and Document
- Create solution.js (always)
- Add solution.py (when time permits)
- Write README.md with explanation
- Add test cases and run them

### Step 4: Commit and Push
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "🧠 Day X: [Problem Name]

- [What you implemented]
- [What you learned]
- [Key insights or optimizations]

Topics: [Relevant topics/tags]"
git push origin main
```
